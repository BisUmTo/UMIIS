# Use Multiplayer Inventory In Singleplayer
Small mod that allows you to use multiplayer inventory in singleplayer too, 
without having to move your stuff to a chest or copying NBT into level.dat


*Side effect: if you join a single player world with two different accounts,
you will have two different inventories.*
